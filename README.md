# Q-Learning-with Arduino 
 
 `Q-learning` is an off policy reinforcement learning algorithm that seeks to find the best action to take given the current state. It’s considered off-policy because the q-learning function learns from actions that are outside the current policy, like taking random actions, and therefore a policy isn’t needed.
